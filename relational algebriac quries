Answer :-
1.	π (pizza) (σ (age > 20 ^ gender="female")(Person ⋈ Eats))

2.	π (name)( σ (gender = "female" ^ pizzeria = "StrawHat")(Person ⋈ Frequents))

3.	π (pizzeria)( σ (price < $10  ^ (name = "Amy" V name = "Fay"))(Eats ⋈ Serves))

4.	π (pizzeria)( σ (price < $10  ^  name = "Amy" ^  name = "Fay" )(Eats ⋈ Serves))

5.	π (name)( π (name)Person  - π (name)( σ(pizza  = "Dominos")(Frequents  ⋈ Eats))

6.	π (pizza) (σ (age > 24 V price < $10)(Serves ⋈ (Person ⋈ Eats)))

7.	π (MAX(age) ( σ ( pizza = "Mushroom") )(Person ⋈ Eats))
